# LureLore (2024 HTN Finalist)

## Description

LureLore is an innovative application designed to enhance the fishing experience by turning each catch into a rich, interactive memory. Using AI technology, it transforms simple fish photos into comprehensive records complete with species identification, rarity ratings, and AI-generated stories.

## Problem Statement

Many fishing enthusiasts struggle to keep track of their catches in a meaningful way, often relying on basic photos that fail to capture the full experience. LureLore solves this by transforming each catch into a rich, interactive memory complete with AI-generated stories, rarity ratings, and a virtual aquarium, turning fleeting moments into lasting, shareable experiences.

## Features

- Fish species identification using AI
- Rarity rating for each catch
- Location and time tracking
- AI-generated "Fish Tale" for each catch
- Virtual aquarium displaying all past catches
- Interactive dashboard to view and manage catches
- Detailed view for each fish with all recorded information

## Technologies Used

- Frontend: React, Three.js
- Backend: Node.js, Express
- Database: MongoDB Atlas
- AI: Google's Gemini API
- Leaflet API
