## TLDR:
Caught a fish? Take a snap. Our AI-powered app identifies the catch, keeps track of stats, and puts that fish in your 3d, virtual aquarium which you can interact with. It's a wholesome way for fishing enthusiasts to reminisnce upon the 'good old days' years into the future. Also, click on any fish in the aquarium, and see all those fishes stats, including date caught, location caught, and a funny joke making ever the more memorable.

Depending on the fish caught, also reel in achievements. Keep track of your first fish caught, your first tropical fish caught, or your first 20+ pound fish! The cherry on top? See on the map where other fish are caught around the world, so that the one fish you've always wanted might just be your next catch.

But remember, Lure lore isn't just about catching fish -- its's about catching lifelong memories.

## Future Features

In the future, we aim to add more 3d fish into the library, which was our main limitation; after all, there's no way to automatically create a 3d fish model for every existing fish. We also aim to improve the 3d scene. So far, we've already curated a scene (which we like to think looks pretty good) of 3d bubbles, simulated realistic fish movement, a nice underwater background, corals, and underwater lighting. But obviously, there's always improvement to be made :)
